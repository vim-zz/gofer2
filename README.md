## Custom Translations

You can add your own translations by creating CSV files in `~/.gofer2/`:

mkdir -p ~/.gofer2
```

2. Add CSV files with your translations:
```csv
# ~/.gofer2/my_translations.csv
en,fr
hello,bonjour
goodbye,au revoir
```

Requirements for CSV files:
- Must have exactly 2 columns
- First row must be headers (e.g., "en,fr")
